# Technical Decisions
## Version: 1.0.0

## Project: GitKit

### 2026-04-09 — Centralized Advanced Branching System
- **Decision**: Replaced the native `prompt()` in the toolbar and the legacy inline dialog in the context menu with a shared, professional-grade `CreateBranchDialog` component.
- **Reason**: To support complex workflows like pushing to remotes and tracking remote branches from a single entry point, while providing real-time validation and smart auto-stashing.
- **Consequences**:
    - Unified UX across Different entry points.
    - Improved safety by checking working tree state proactively.
    - Better error handling and user feedback.
- **Status**: Active

### 2026-04-09 — Use Git CLI for Advanced Stash Push
- **Decision**: Implemented `stash_save_advanced` by invoking the `git` CLI directly via `std::process::Command` instead of using `libgit2` bindings.
- **Reason**: `libgit2` does not natively support the `--keep-index` workflow (which is essential for stashing only unstaged changes). Invoking the CLI is the most reliable way to achieve this standard Git behavior.
- **Consequences**:
    - Requires `git` to be available in the system's PATH.
    - Enables features like selective stashing and including untracked files with custom messages.
- **Status**: Active

### 2026-04-10 — Orchestrated Multi-Commit Cherry Pick with Rust bindings
- **Decision**: Developed the multi-commit sequence recursively in frontend calling pure `cherry_pick_commit` one OID at a time under Rust, instead of executing looping block natively.
- **Reason**: Maintaining `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` manually via `git2` while orchestrating array tracking provides UI visibility over "Remaining Tasks" seamlessly and leaves pausing strictly atomic without blocking execution threads or dropping sequence state if closed.
- **Consequences**:
    - Simplifies state restoration after restart/crash.
    - Requires `cherryPickSlice` and `invokeCherryPick` recursion pattern on the frontend.
- **Status**: Active

### 2026-04-10 — Three-Pane Monaco Editor for Conflict Resolution
- **Decision**: Implemented a 3-pane side-by-side Monaco `Editor` view instead of standard `DiffEditor` for conflict resolution, explicitly pushing raw disk files to the center pane (which holds conflict markers).
- **Reason**: Standard Git conflict resolution relies heavily on developers manually cleaning or merging "Ours" and "Theirs". A 3-pane structured view gives raw visibility before saving the resolved state to the Git index directly.
- **Alternatives considered**: Using generic `DiffEditor` modes. However, 3 separate `Editor` instances in a flex layout ensure better state stability without Monaco diff race conditions.
- **Status**: Active

### 2026-04-10 — Monaco Line-Boundary Alignment for Git Conflict Markers
- **Decision**: Implemented an explicit whitespace-padding algorithm in `conflictParser.ts` for ours vs theirs content array maps rather than trimming to blocks.
- **Reason**: Maintaining exactly parallel `line.length()` to the raw git file across all panels enables `monacoDecorations.ts` mapped delta-decorations to accurately hit target rows synchronously avoiding diff coordinate bugs, and synchronized 3-way vertical scrolling remains locked 1:1.
- **Alternatives considered**: Filtering out `normal` code exclusively for the side panels and dropping empty spacing padding.
- **Status**: Active

### [2026-04-11] — ROW & SVG VIRTUALIZATION
- **Decision**: Implemented vertical row virtualization and dynamic SVG edge filtering.
- **Reason**: Standard HTML rendering became slow (>100ms lag) at 1000+ commits.
- **Alternatives considered**: Heavy backend-side SVG tiling (too complex for state sync).
- **Status**: Active

### 2026-04-11 — Overflow Visible for Dialog Overlays
- **Decision**: Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible` for `.create-branch-dialog`.
- **Reason**: The dialog contains absolute-positioned dropdowns (Source Branch selector) that extend beyond the dialog boundaries. `overflow: hidden` was clipping these menus, making them inaccessible.
- **Alternatives considered**: Using React Portals for the dropdown. However, for a one-off UI fix, modifying the CSS to allow visibility is more efficient and maintains the current architecture.
- **Status**: Active
